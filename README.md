### Question 3:

To start, the page contains the head and then the body tags.
- The **"head tag"** contains the metadata, for example, the title of the document, and the specific info of the web page.
- Then comes the body, which is the body of the page.
This body is nested, coming first the **"center tag"**, which is used to set the align of text into the center. Then, comes
the **"table id tag"**, where you specify the attributes of that table using JavaScript. After this, comes **"tbody tag"**,
which is used to group the body content in an HTML table. Then the **"tr tag"** comes, which specifies a row in an HTML
table, and the cells inside it are defined using **"th tag"** which is a header cell and the **"td tag"** which is a standard
cell. Both of the tags support additional control over how to fit them into columns. Lastly but not least comes
the **"td tag"** which defines the standard cells, like the weight, and the aligment of the text. Which contains a **"tbody tag"**
and then a **"tr tag"** containing **"td tags"** having all the inf of the news.

### Question 4:

There are two files we need to analize, the **"hn.js"** and the **"news.css"**.
- Firstly, the **"hn.js"** file specifies the functions and what they do.
- Secondly, the **"news.css"** specifies the format of the elements, like the font, the size, the color of the text, 		  etc.
So, in conclusion the difference between them is that the first one specifies what the function does, and the second one
specifies the format of the objects.

### Question 5:

There are 7 resources:             |   The requests where:
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------
news.ycombinator.com	           |   GET
news.css?FipHmofufc0acGUN2LQH      |   GET
y18.gif                            |   GET
s.gif                              |   GET
hn.js?FipHmofufc0acGUN2LQH         |   GET
grayarrow.gif                      |   GET
favicon.ico                        |   GET
	
All of the resources use the Web Server **"Nginx"**, which can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
